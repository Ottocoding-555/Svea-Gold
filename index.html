            <h2>Understanding Gold and Silver Price Trends</h2>
            <p>Gold and silver have long been cornerstones of wealth preservation, with prices fluctuating based on economic conditions, inflation, and global demand. From 2000 to 2024, gold prices soared from a low of $263.80/oz to a high of $2,785.87/oz, reflecting its role as a safe-haven asset during crises like the 2008 financial crash and 2020 pandemic. Silver, often called "the poor man's gold," followed a similar trajectory, peaking at $34.75/oz in 2024 after dipping to $4.07/oz in 2001.</p>
            <p>The gold/silver ratio, which measures how many ounces of silver equal one ounce of gold, offers insights into relative value. In 2000, the ratio hovered around 64.5, but it spiked to 125.8 in 2020 during economic uncertainty, showing silver’s volatility compared to gold’s stability. By 2024, the ratio settled at 91.4, suggesting a potential undervaluation of silver—a signal for investors.</p>
            <p>Why track these trends? For investors in Stockholm or globally, understanding historical data helps predict future movements. Gold’s upward trend since 2000 aligns with rising inflation and currency devaluation, while silver’s industrial uses (e.g., solar panels, electronics) drive its demand. Use our chart to toggle between gold prices, silver prices, and the ratio, and see how these metals have shaped financial markets over two decades.</p>
