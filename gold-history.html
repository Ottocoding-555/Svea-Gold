            <h1>The History of Gold as a Medium of Exchange</h1>
            <p>Discover how gold evolved from a traded treasure in ancient civilizations to a global financial asset. This timeline explores key periods and the civilizations that shaped gold’s role as currency.</p>

            <div class="article-section" id="early-use">
                <h2>Early Use of Gold (4000 BCE - 1200 BCE)</h2>
                <p>Gold’s history as a medium of exchange began around 4000 BCE. In the <strong>Egyptian Civilization</strong>, gold from Nubia fueled trade and adorned pharaohs, symbolizing divine wealth. The <strong>Sumerian Civilization</strong> in Mesopotamia used gold alongside silver in early markets, while the <strong>Indus Valley Civilization</strong> crafted gold jewelry for commerce. These ancient societies established gold as a valuable trade asset.</p>

            <div class="article-section" id="rise-coinage">
                <h2>Rise of Coinage (1200 BCE - 476 CE)</h2>
                <p>Gold coinage emerged around 700 BCE, transforming trade. The <strong>Achaemenid Persian Empire</strong> minted the gold <em>daric</em>, boosting commerce across Asia and Europe. The <strong>Roman Empire</strong> relied on the <em>aureus</em> to fund its vast economy, while China’s <strong>Zhou Dynasty</strong> used gold ingots for elite transactions. Standardized coins made gold a universal currency.</p>

            <div class="article-section" id="medieval">
                <h2>Medieval Period (476 CE - 1453 CE)</h2>
                <p>Post-Rome, gold remained vital. The <strong>Byzantine Empire</strong> issued the <em>solidus</em>, a trusted coin for Mediterranean trade. The <strong>Islamic Caliphates</strong> minted the <em>dinar</em>, linking East and West via the Silk Road. China’s <strong>Tang Dynasty</strong> used gold in tribute, complementing silver. Gold’s stability powered medieval economies.</p>

            <div class="article-section" id="exploration">
                <h2>Age of Exploration (1453 CE - 1815 CE)</h2>
                <p>Gold drove exploration. The <strong>Spanish Empire</strong> plundered New World gold, minting <em>escudos</em> that reshaped global wealth. The <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> used the <em>sultani</em> to sustain trade dominance, while the <strong>Ming Dynasty</strong> in China integrated gold into its tribute system. This era cemented gold’s economic power.</p>

            <div class="article-section" id="industrial">
                <h2>Industrial Age (1815 CE - 1914 CE)</h2>
                <p>The gold standard era began in 1821 with the <strong>British Empire</strong>, using sovereigns to anchor trade. The <strong>United States</strong> grew its gold reserves post-1849 Gold Rush, while China’s <strong>Qing Dynasty</strong> used gold amid decline. Gold-backed currencies stabilized industrial economies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-section" id="modern">
                <h2>Modern Era (1914 CE - Present)</h2>
                <p>The gold standard faded after 1914, ending in the U.S. in 1971. The <strong>United States</strong> remains a gold market leader, the <strong>European Union</strong> holds vast reserves, and <strong>China</strong> dominates production and buying as of March 28, 2025. In 2025, gold’s role as an investment asset shines brighter amid rising prices (e.g., $2,785.87/oz in 2024) and global uncertainty, making it a focal point for investors in Stockholm and beyond.</p>
